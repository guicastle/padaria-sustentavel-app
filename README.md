Stock control project for bakeries - Avoid wasting food 

Sustainable bakery - We developed an app for bakeries to track their food waste costs. The app allows for image recognition of products, price capture, and calculation of total waste costs. Additionally, it features data export capabilities, enabling easy sharing of the total waste cost for the month. The app also generates detailed reports, showing item-by-item which products had the highest losses during the period, aiding in better management and reduction of waste.
